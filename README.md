# Intelligent IoT Data Management Platform 🚀

A modular platform for intelligent anomaly detection and visualization of time series sensor data from IoT devices.

## Overview

The Intelligent IoT Data Management Platform is designed to provide a smarter way to manage, analyze, and visualize sensor data collected from a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. By leveraging real-time data collection and advanced analytics, the platform automatically monitors incoming sensor streams, identifies faults and anomalies, and presents insights through a modern, interactive dashboard. The system is suitable for a wide range of IoT use cases, from smart home applications to industrial monitoring and automation.

## Goals

- **Detect anomalies and faults in real-time sensor data:**  
  The platform continuously analyzes incoming time series data to discover unusual patterns that may indicate system faults or critical issues. Early detection enables proactive maintenance and smarter decision-making.

- **Visualize correlations and anomalies:**  
  Users can view sensor data trends, correlations between different sensor streams, and detected anomalies through intuitive, interactive visualizations. This helps users understand relationships in their data and quickly spot problems.

- **Support integration with live data sources:**  
  The backend is architected to allow easy integration with live data streams, making it possible to connect to real-world sensors and receive insights in real time.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js** for building a dynamic single-page application with a responsive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS** for fast, consistent, and modern styling, ensuring the UI is both attractive and user-friendly.

### Backend
- **Node.js** provides a performant server environment for handling API requests, data validation, and session management.
- **WebSocket** enables real-time, bidirectional communication, making instant data updates and live visualizations possible.

### Data Science
- **Python** with libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Jupyter** is used during development for exploratory data analysis and prototyping models.
- **Plotly** provides rich, interactive charts and graphs for advanced visualizations.
- **Flask** exposes machine learning models and data processing workflows as APIs for easy backend integration.

### DevOps & Collaboration
- **Docker** ensures consistent environments and simplifies deployment across different systems.
- **GitHub** is used for version control, collaboration, and continuous development/deployment, with clear project tracking and code review processes.

## Features

- **Upload and filter sensor data (CSV, JSON):**  
  Users can upload their own sensor datasets in common formats, apply filters, and prepare data for analysis.

- **Correlation analysis and anomaly detection:**  
  The system identifies relationships between sensor streams using correlation analysis, and detects outliers using multiple machine learning approaches, including Z-score, Isolation Forest, LSTM, and One-Class SVM.

- **Interactive dashboard with graph visualizations:**  
  The web application provides a graph dashboard for visualizing sensor data, correlations, and anomalies. Light and dark mode options are included for user comfort.

- **Export options (PNG, CSV):**  
  Users can export processed data and visualizations for further analysis or reporting.

- **Authentication (login/registration):**  
  Secure endpoints enable user login and registration, with planned support for role-based access control.

- **Real-time data streaming (WebSocket-ready):**  
  The backend is set up to support real-time streaming, so users can connect live sensors for up-to-date analysis and insights.

- **Modular, Dockerized structure:**  
  Every component is modular and containerized, making the system easy to extend, maintain, and deploy.

## Next Steps

- **Heatmaps for correlations, sensor grouping, draggable graphs:**  
  Future updates will add support for more advanced visualizations, including heatmaps to show sensor relationships, grouping of related sensors, and draggable time windows for easier analysis.

- **Full pipeline automation and real-time integration:**  
  The goal is to automate the entire process—from data filtering and correlation analysis to anomaly detection—so users can get results in real-time with minimal manual intervention.

- **Enhanced mobile responsiveness and UI controls:**  
  The frontend will be improved for better usability on mobile devices and large sensor networks, with optimized dropdowns, filters, and controls.

- **Expanded documentation and onboarding:**  
  Clearer guides and training material will be provided to help new users and contributors get started quickly.
