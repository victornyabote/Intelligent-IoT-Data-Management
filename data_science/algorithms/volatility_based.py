def volatility_based(df, streams, start_date, end_date, threshold=None):
    """
    Detect outliers based on the volatility (standard deviation) of each stream.

    The volatility of each stream is calculated over the specified period.
    We use the negative of the standard deviation as the metric (since higher volatility results in a lower negative value).
    If this metric is lower than the threshold (computed as mean - std of the metric), the stream is flagged as an outlier.

    Note: The computed metric is stored in the key 'avg_corr' to maintain a consistent output format.

    Parameters:
    - df: DataFrame containing data with 'created_at' as index.
    - streams: List of column names (streams) to analyze (at least 3 streams).
    - start_date: Start time (str or datetime).
    - end_date: End time (str or datetime).
    - threshold: Threshold to determine an outlier. If not provided, the value (mean - std) of the metric is used.

    Returns:
    - A dictionary with keys as stream names and values as a dict containing:
      - avg_corr: The negative standard deviation of the stream.
      - is_outlier: True if the stream is detected as an outlier.
